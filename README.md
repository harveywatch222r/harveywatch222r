hello! wip

pls don't be mad that i still cant finish strawpage🙂‍↕️. i hate my provider!
***
heres my main dni list!
1) trans-homo-quuerphobia
2) msi antics ; u think jimmy is groomer ; and so on. guys, i had a strong hyperfixation on MSI for about 7-8 years - they were literally the foundation of my entire personality. and i wont be pleased if u insult them right in front of me or smthing.
3) MAP / AAP person
4) w*lbur supports. i used to be like that, but after looking into the situation, i realized that i was wrong ^_^
5) homestuck fandom. sorry, but this fandom caused me, albeit a small, but still trauma. and i dont want to contact people from this fandom, plus it's a constant reminder of my past.
6) joost klein antics
7) constant reminder of my past and so on. if we communicate for a long time, and u constantly remind me of my past, ill freely block u.

 will be replenished...
