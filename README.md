pls don't be mad that i still cant finish strawpage🙂‍↕️. i hate my provider!
***
heres my main dni list!
1) trans-homo-quuerphobia
2) msi antics ; u think jimmy is groomer ; and so on. guys, i had a strong hyperfixation on MSI for about 7-8 years - they were literally the foundation of my entire personality. and i wont be pleased if u insult them right in front of me or smthing.
3) MAP / AAP person
4) w*lbur supports. i used to be like that, but after looking into the situation, i realized that i was wrong ^_^
5) homestuck fandom. sorry, but this fandom caused me, albeit a small, but still trauma. and i dont want to contact people from this fandom, plus it's a constant reminder of my past.
6) joost klein antics
7) constant reminder of my past and so on. if we communicate for a long time, and u constantly remind me of my past, ill freely block u.
8) thorkie lovers. 
9) pro- dark- shippers. u need a therapy.
10) heavy dni is ure posting / support / search will wood photos, where he is a 19 or younger. ure FUCKING DISGUSTING. 
11) <img width="408" height="133" alt="Снимок экрана 2026-01-03 092245" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9425439-63ac-4190-9b22-07e578014991" /> & <img width="126" height="230" alt="Снимок экрана 2026-01-03 092237" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/de7a0e64-67a0-4374-9438-9c134a631576" />.and his friends. Do not incite hatred towards those born in Russia/Pakistan etc. 
12) DSMP FD, dniuf.
13) You harass people who were born in the "wrong country" (Russia, Pakistan, etc.), and you think that if all people were born there, then they support terrorism, etc.
14) RATS HATERS. HEAVY DNI.
15) radical russophobia. This relates to point 11 of my DNI-list.
16) FISH MOONEY FANS. HEAVY DNI.
17) agere regressors ; regressors to puppies ; etc. ure on **VERY** thin ice, i dont know how to communicate with you.
18) Aggressive WLW fans. I have nothing against WLW as long as you don't start aggressively speaking out against MLM pairings, saying things like "straight people don't exist" (a local Russian joke from the Russian queer community, but still, you never know, someone might be making that joke outside of Russia too) and similar things.
19) skin stealers. you all know, about who im talking.
20) selfshippers. no, guys, ure so fucking strange.


 will be replenished....

By the way, I always support victims, as long as it doesn't involve my hyperfixations (the same MSI), so if you've been accused of something, please don't be surprised if I stop talk with you.

I use a translator to write complex sentences, so there will sometimes be delays in responses. :p

And sometimes I'm TOO LAZY to edit messages. But I don't write with periods!

I like to create AUs related to my hyperfixations/songs (like Will Wood) and Marvel. I love DC and Marvel, especially Gotham.

I really love making friends!! Please feel free to join me, even if my nickname doesn't have C+H. Or, if I don't specify anything else, like DNI, etc.

Please sign my atabook :з. 

You CAN be inspired by my skins if you want, but don't copy them exactly.

I'm colorblind. I can't tell the difference between bright blue and bright purple, or dark blue and dark purple. So don't be surprised if I say my skin is blue when it's purple.

I might be shy at first until I feel comfortable.

And when I play on my phone, I go AFK.

i love yapping about rats and my will wood au A LOT. tell me if u uncomfortable!

my hcurrent hyperfixations is **MARVEL**, Gotham and ***STRANGER THINGS***. i love it. 

did u know im not deadpool kinnie/local 

# ***My social battery drains in literally 10-20 minutes and sometimes takes a very long time to charge. Please take this into account.***
